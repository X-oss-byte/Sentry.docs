## Setting Up Code Mappings

In order to utilize features such as suspect commits and stack trace linking, you will need to set up a code mapping. This is a mapping between the source code in your repository and the source code in your stack traces. You can find information on how to set up code mappings in our [Set Up Code Mappings](/product/issues/suspect-commits/#2-set-up-code-mappings) docs.

For Java projects, package names complicate the mapping. Before mapping the file name, Sentry uses custom logic to convert the frame data to a derived file path. Use the following steps to determine the correct **Stack Trace Root** **Source Code Root** for your code mapping:

First, navigate to a stack trace that you wish to map. Find an In App frame, which is denoted by a bubble on the right side of the frame. The `module` will be shown as the first piece of text at the left hand side of the frame header (marked as **1** in the below screenshot). In this example, it is `com.example.vu.android.MainActivity`. Hovering over the module will show the absolute path to the file (marked as **2** in the below screenshot). In this example, it is `MainActivity.java`.

Next, calculate the derived file path. Take the frame `module` and replace all `.` characters with `/`. Then, replace the last item (`MainActivity` in this example) with the absolute path found earlier (`MainActivity.java`). In this example, the derived file path is `com/example/vu/android/MainActivity.java`.

Finally, use the derived file path to determine the **Stack Trace Root** and **Source Code Root** using the steps detailed in the [Stack Trace Root and Source Code Root](/product/issues/suspect-commits/#stack-trace-root-and-source-code-root) docs.
